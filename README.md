**Note:** If you would like to view the project without setting it up on your local machine, I have deployed it [here](https://basic-dashboard-omega.vercel.app/)<br /><br />

If you are visiting the deployed website, please wait for a few seconds after submitting login or signup form as the backend server is hosted on the free tier of Render due to which it shuts down the server after a period of inactivity. It will start once an API is called.<br /><br />

# Steps to run the project locally

<br/>

## Serving frontend

### Step 1
Open a terminal in `/frontend` directory.

### Step 2
Use command `npm install` to install the required node modules.

### Step 3
Use command `npm start` to run the frontend server.

<br/>

## Serving Backend

### Step 1
Open a new terminal in `/backend` directory.

### Step 2
Run `npm install` to install required packages.

### Step 3
Finally, use `npm run dev` to run the backend server.

Both the frontend and backend servers should start and be available on `http://localhost:3000/` and `http://localhost:3001/` respectively.<br/>
Congratulations! You have successfully served the project on your local machine. ðŸŽ‰
